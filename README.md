# TripSorterApp

TripSorterApp is an Angular App built with TypeScript, HTML5 and Angular >= 4.
I have implemented my own version of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one city to another and a min-priority queue to get the best efficiency out of Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
